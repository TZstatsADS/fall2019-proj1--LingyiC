# ADS Project 1: R Notebook on Lyrics Analysis
### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

The original lyrics.csv file is more than 100M (cannot push to github), so I save it as .zip file.
